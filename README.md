🚗 Vehicle Registration Analysis Dashboard
This is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit to analyze vehicle registration data from an investor's perspective. It provides key metrics like Year-over-Year (YoY), Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ), and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth to help stakeholders understand market trends.

🔧 Setup Instructions
To run this dashboard locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.7+

pip package manager

Clone the Repository (or download the files):
Get all the project files, including the dashboard.py script and the data folders.

Install Required Libraries:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

pip install streamlit pandas plotly-express


Organize Your Data:
Ensure your data files are organized in the correct folder structure. The script expects to find the data in year-specific folders, which should be in the same directory as the dashboard.py script.

.
├── 2023/
│   ├── 2023-JAN.csv
│   └── 2023-FEB.csv
│   └── ...
├── 2024/
│   ├── 2024-JAN.csv
│   └── ...
├── 2025/
│   └── ...
└── dashboard.py


Run the Application:
Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command:

streamlit run dashboard.py


A new tab should automatically open in your web browser with the running application.

📊 Data Assumptions
The application makes the following assumptions about the data:

File Naming Convention: Data for each month is stored in a separate CSV file named in the format YYYY-MON.csv (e.g., 2024-JAN.csv, 2024-FEB.csv).

Folder Structure: The CSV files are located inside folders named after the corresponding year (e.g., all 2024 files are in a folder named 2024).

CSV File Content: Each CSV file must contain the following columns:

Maker: The name of the vehicle manufacturer.

2W: The number of two-wheeler registrations.

3W: The number of three-wheeler registrations.

4W: The number of four-wheeler registrations.

🗺️ Feature Roadmap
If this project were to be continued, here are some potential features and improvements that could be added:

Advanced Manufacturer Analysis:

A dedicated page to compare specific manufacturers head-to-head.

Calculate and visualize changes in market share over time for each manufacturer.

Geographic Analysis:

If state-level data becomes available, add a map visualization to show registration hotspots.

Filters to drill down into specific states or regions.

Fuel Type Analysis:

Incorporate data on fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, EV) to track the adoption of electric vehicles.

Add filters and charts to compare EV vs. ICE vehicle registration trends.

Enhanced UI/UX:

Add a "Data Export" button to allow users to download the filtered data as a CSV.

Implement a dark mode theme for the dashboard.

Add tooltips with more detailed information on the charts.

Technical Improvements:

Deploy the application to a cloud service (like Streamlit Community Cloud or AWS) for public access.

Set up a more robust data pipeline to automatically fetch and update the data from the Vahan Dashboard source.
